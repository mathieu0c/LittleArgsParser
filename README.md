# LittleArgsParser

This is an awful implementation of a small parser for command line arguments. I tried to make it kinda generic and simple to use.

It is not really efficient and I am not even sure how this gets to work but it does.

## Install

```bash
cd libLittleArgsParser
cmake -Bbuild && cmake --build build && sudo cmake --build build -- install
```
